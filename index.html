			<p>In this game, there are
				three devils and three angels must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people,
				 under the constraint that, for both banks, if there are angels present on the bank, 
				 they cannot be outnumbered by devils (if they were, the devils would eat the angels). 
				The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.</p>
